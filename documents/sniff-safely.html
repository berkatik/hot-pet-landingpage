      <h3>TIPS FOR PET CHATS AND DATING</h3>
      <p>
        We know that it will be very exciting for a furry and cute member of
        your family to be able to fall in love, socialize, find a couple, but
        remember that for this reason you are communicating with a human you do
        not know! You must always be careful when communicating. Prioritize your
        safety when making initial messages or meeting in person. While you may
        not be able to control the actions of others, there are also things you
        can do to help you stay safe during your Hot-Pet experience.
      </p>
      <h3>Online Security.</h3>
      <h3>Never send money or share Financial Information</h3>
      <p>
        It is strictly forbidden to trade animals within or through this
        application or to be an intermediary in this and similar situation.
        Never send money, especially via bank transfer, even if for this reason
        or the person you are talking to claims that their pet or himself is in
        an emergency. Making a bank transfer is like sending cash. It's almost
        impossible to reverse the transaction or track where the money went.
        Never share information that can be used to access your financial
        accounts. If another user asks you for money, tries to sell you a pet,
        let us know immediately.
      </p>
      <h3>Protect Your Personal Information</h3>
      <p>
        Never share personal information, such as your Social Security number,
        home or work address, or details about your daily routine (such as
        walking your dog in a particular location every Monday) with people you
        don't know
      </p>
      <h3>Stay On The Platform</h3>
      <p>
        Keep conversations on the Hot-pet platform as you try to get to know a
        pet and its family. Malicious users often try to move the chat
        immediately to SMS, messaging apps, email or phone.
      </p>
      <h3>Pet mating and puppy sharing agreement</h3>
      <p>
        This agreement, which is among the agreements that you accept when a
        user account is opened on the platform, confirms the legal sharing of
        puppies that will be born after a match that will consist of pet
        friendships that will be acquired, in this way. The user is deemed to
        have legally committed to the requirements of this agreement. If you
        can, still keep it hidden by signing the contract on paper. Detailed
        information of each user is reserved by us, even if you do not see it.
        If you notice any disconnection or suspicious speech or behavior in the
        communication established by the pet family after the match, please let
        us know immediately.

      <h3>
        In practice, it is forbidden to have a paid pet or be an intermediary!
      </h3>
      <p>
        Hot-Pet is a platform created only to make it easier for your pet to
        communicate freely with his or her species, just like you. Anyone who
        uses the Hot-Pet app first within the borders of the Republic of Turkey
        Food, Agriculture and livestock according to 5996 law released by the
        Ministry of animal production, sale, housing, places of education and
        published in the Official Gazette numbered and dated October 2011 about
        8 28078, is responsible for the regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is then subject to regulations and legislation related to the sale of
        pet animals in the laws of the country in which it lives. For this
        reason, it is forbidden to participate in any direct or indirect sale of
        animals on the platform. If you receive a request about this, please let
        us know.
      </p>
      <h3>Do not contact pets from another city or country.</h3>
      <p>
        You can only socialize and match your pet in the city and country where
        you are your own. Remember. Do not give priority to pet families who are
        in your country or city for a holiday or temporary period. Consider
        subsequent miscommunication and non-follow-up.
      </p>
      <h3>Report all suspicious and disturbing behavior</h3>
      <p>
        You notice when someone crosses the line and we need to know when they
        do. Block and report anyone who violates our Terms. Here are some
        examples of violations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Requests for money or donations</li>
        <li>Underage users</li>
        <li>
          Messages containing harassment, threats and insults İnappropriate or
          harmful behavior during or after a meeting in person
        </li>
        <li>Fake profiles</li>
        <li>
          İt is spam or solicitation, including links to commercial websites or
          attempts to sell products or services.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can report any concerns about suspicious behavior on any profile
          page or in the message window
          <a href="../contact.html">here.</a> Check out our
          <a href="./community-rules.html">community rules</a> for more
          information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Protect Your Account</h3>
      <p>
        Be sure to select a strong password and always be careful when logging
        into your account from a public or public computer. Hot-pet will never
        send you an email asking for your username and password
      </p>
      <p>
        if you receive an email asking for account information,
        <a href="../contact.html">let us</a> know immediately.
      </p>
      <h3>Face-To-Face Dating</h3>
      <h3>Don’t Rush</h3>
      <p>
        Take the time before you agree to meet or chat outside of the Hot-pet
        and try to get to know the pet's environment and family. Don't be afraid
        to ask questions for any danger signs or personal reasons that disrupt
        the deal. A phone or video call can be a useful scanning tool before
        meeting.
      </p>
      <h3>Meet in public places and stay there</h3>
      <p>
        See in a crowded, public place for the first few times (cat owners too).
        Choose park or garden environments. Never meet at your home, pet family
        home, or any other private place. End the appointment if the person
        forces you to go to a private place on the first call.
      </p>
      <h3>Tell your friends and family about your plans</h3>
      <p>
        Tell a friend or family member your plans, including when and where to
        go. Don't go alone, if possible. Always keep your mobile phone with you
        and charged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before taking your pet to another house Before hosting your own cat or
        dog in another pet house, if possible, get your furry friend registered
        and chipped to your person. Do not hand over your pet's report card and
        ID to the other party for any reason. Do not respond to any material
        requests from the other party, even after receiving your pet. Do not
        entrust if you are not sure of the identity information and address of
        the person you delivered. Get visual evidence, correspondence, or even a
        pet contract on your side when delivering.
      </p>
      <p>Remember, you are the only one in charge of your pet!</p>
      <h3>Be In Control Of Your Transportation</h3>
      <p>
        We want you to check how to get back and forth to your meeting so that
        you can leave at any time. If you're driving yourself, it's a good idea
        to have a backup plan, such as a ride-sharing app or a friend to pick
        you up.
      </p>
      <h3>Do not leave drinks or personal items unattended!</h3>
      <p>
        Know where the treats come from and where they are at all times. Do not
        accept treats on home visits if possible. Accept only drinks served
        directly by the bartender or waiter on outdoor meetings. Many substances
        that are thrown into drinks to facilitate sexual assault are odorless,
        colorless and tasteless. Also, always keep your phone, purse, wallet,
        and anything that contains your personal information with you.
      </p>
      <h3>If You Feel Uncomfortable, Leave.</h3>
      <p>
        If it bothers you, it's okay to end the appointment early. If you don't
        feel safe, you never have to leave your pet if you don't find the
        environment healthy. If your instincts tell you that something is wrong
        or that you feel unsafe, immediately leave the environment, or if you
        are in an outside environment, seek help from the waiter or around you.
      </p>
