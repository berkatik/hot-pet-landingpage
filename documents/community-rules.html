    <h3>Community Rules. </h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Hot-Pet community. If you are honest, kind,
      and respectful of others, you are always welcome here. If you
      don't choose to be like this, you won't be able to stay here for
      long. Our goal is to ensure that users can express themselves
      freely, as long as it does not cause discomfort to other
      people. At Hot-Pet, everyone is subject to equal standards.
      We ask you to be understanding, to think before you do
      anything, to adhere to community principles in online and
      offline actions. Your offline behavior may cause your Hot-Pet
      account to be cancelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is a list of our community principles. If you violate any
      of these principles, you may be banned from Hot-Pet. We're
      serious, you don't want us to threaten you by grrrrr —
      because once we do, we won't take it back. We recommend
      that you report any behavior that violates our principles and
      read our principles of <a href="./sniff-safely.html">Sniff Safely.</a> 
    </p>
    <h3>Inappropriate Content </h3>
    <p>
      We'll insist on reminding you every time. You speak only for
      your pet! Please be polite and behave appropriately for public
      consumption. Nudity should not be sexual content, and the
      practice should not contain personal desires. Please use the
      app clean. 
    </p>
    <h3>Harassment</h3>
    <p>
      Do not engage in any targeted abuse or harassment against
      other users or encourage others to be found. This includes 
      sharing your personal visual content with a suitable pet (
      hence the parent you are talking to). Harassment, threats,
      bullying or similar complaints are taken very seriously by us. 
    </p>
    <h3>Violence and physical harm </h3>
    <p>
      We do not allow images of violence, brutality or blood on
      Hot-Pet, or any violent, threatening behavior or content,
      including threatening and inciting terror. Physical assault,
      oppression and any violent behavior are strictly prohibited.
      Content that advocates or glorifies suicide or self-harm is also
      not allowed. In these cases, we can take several steps to
      assist the user, including contacting crisis sources. 
    </p>
    <h3>Specific Information </h3>
    <p>
      Do not explicitly publish private information belonging to
      yourself or anyone else. This includes Social Security
      numbers, passports, passwords, financial information or
      unlisted contact information such as phone numbers, email
      addresses, home/work addresses. 
    </p>
    <h3>Message Downpour </h3>
    <p>
      Don't be fake. Real. Do not use Hot-Pet to redirect people to other websites via a link or in a different way. 
    </p>
    <h3>Promotion or insistently request</h3>
    <p>
      It is forbidden to force other users in Hot-Pet. There is no
      problem inviting the pet owner to an event or place where
      you are making your matches, but we may delete your
      account if the purpose of your profile is to advertise your
      event or business or product. We're excited for your pet shop 
      discount next week, but please don't use Hot - pet to
      advertise it. 
    </p>
    <h3>Pet Trade </h3>
    <p>
      Owning or brokering any pet for free or for a fee is strictly
      prohibited and will result in the account being banned from
      Hot-pet. In addition, he will be pursued for punishment under
      the law, where he is on the borders of the country where he
      lives legally.

    Also, please don't upload different pet photos into an account
    and speak on behalf of someone else's peti. Even if it is not
    installed in our automatic filter, it will certainly be installed in
    us and you can be banned from Hot-Pet. But you can open
    other accounts for different pads in a profile, so you can

      Using Hot-Pet is always fun! Use Hot-Pet when walking with
      your dog on the beach, use Hot-Pet when the month of

      Hot-Pet to calm down when you're upset, on vacation, or
