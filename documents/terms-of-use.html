      <h3>10.Purchases.</h3>
      <p>
        Generally. From time to time, Hot-Pet may offer products and services
        (“in-app purchases”) for purchase through iTunes, Google Play, operator
        billing, direct billing by Hot-Pet, or other payment platforms
        authorized by Hot-Pet. In-app purchase if you choose to make an
        appropriate payment provider and will be asked to confirm the purchase
        with your payment method (card, such as iTunes or Google Play or
        third-party account) ("payment method"void) application for the services
        you choose to purchase, in addition to your payment, and similar taxes
        are billed at a fee that can be applied to specified for hot-pet’ s or
        any third party you allow to your billing account which is available
        for. If you purchase a periodic subscription that repeats itself through
        an in-app purchase, your payment method will be billed continuously for
        the subscription until you cancel it. After your initial subscription
        start period and again after the subsequent subscription period, your
        subscription will automatically continue for an additional period equal
        to the price you accepted when subscribing.
      </p>
      <h3>Automatic renewal; payment by Automatic Card</h3>
      <p>
        Subscriptions are automatically renewed until you terminate or cancel
        the subscription. When you purchase a subscription, your payment method
        will continue to be billed monthly from the fee you accepted when you
        first subscribed within 24 hours of your first purchase date. Your card
        payment information will be stored in accordance with the contract and
        then used for payment by Automatic Card. Objections to a pre-made
        payment should be directed directly to customer support if they are
        billed by Hot-Pet or by a related third-party account, such as iTunes.
        You can also appeal by contacting your bank or payment provider, who can
        provide you with more information about your rights as well as
        applicable time limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can unconditionally cancel your card automatic payment permission at
        any time by going to the settings of Hot-Pet or the relevant third-party
        account, but remember that you still have to pay outstanding debts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to change or terminate your subscription, even if you have
        deleted your account with us or the Hot-Pet app on your device, you must
        log in to the third-party account (or settings on Hot-Pet) and follow
        the instructions to terminate or cancel your subscription. Deleting your
        Hot-Pet account or hot-Pet app from your device does not terminate or
        cancel your subscription; Hot-Pet will retain all amounts charged in
        your payment method until you terminate or cancel your subscription at
        Hot-Pet or a third-party account. If you terminate or cancel your
        subscription, you can use your subscription until the end of the current
        subscription period on that date, and your subscription will not renew
        after the current period.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can edit your payment method information by visiting Hot-Pet and
        going to the Settings. If the payment is not successful due to an
        insufficient balance or other reason, or if the payment method cannot
        edit your information, cancel it, and continue to be responsible for
        amounts that cannot be paid, and if it is updated, you authorize us to
        continue billing by the payment method. This may cause a change in your
        payment invoice dates. You also authorize us to obtain updated or
        modified credit card or debit card expiration dates or Numbers as
        provided by your credit or debit card provider. Your payment terms will
        be based on your payment method and may be determined by agreements
        between you and your financial institution, credit card provider, or
        other providers of your chosen payment method.
      </p>
      <h3>Refunds.</h3>
      <p>
        In general, not all fees for purchases are refundable, and there can be
        no refunds or receivables for partially used periods. We may make an
        exception if a refund request has been made for a subscription option
        within fourteen days of the transaction date, or if the laws applicable
        in your jurisdiction provide for a refund. For subscribers residing in
        the EU or European Economic Area, you are entitled to a full refund
        without specifying the reason for 14 days after the start of the
